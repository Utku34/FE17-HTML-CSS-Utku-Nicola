       <h1>Water Is Wealth </h1>
       <p>
        In Honolulu, environmental activists are seeking to displace the legacy of settler-colonial engineering and to remake their city according to Indigenous design knowledge. What is happening in Waikīkī might be a model for a new watershed urbanism.

            <h2> What Cost Waikīkī?</h2>
The name Waikīkī means “spouting waters,” a nod to the flowing waterways and rich farmland of taro, rice, and fishponds that in precolonial times characterized this landscape on the island of Oʻahu. 1 Today, Waikīkī remains perhaps the best-known public place in Hawai‘i, yet its image in the popular imagination betrays none of this history. Instead, most Americans’ perceptions of the Hawaiian Kingdom remain essentially static, stalled in the year of Hawaiian statehood — 1959 — even as Waikīkī Beach has continued to be shaped by hyper-global commerce.

Waikīkī stretches for less than a mile and a half on the southeastern shore of the archipelago’s most populous island, which is also home to the state’s capital city, Honolulu. Kalākaua Avenue, bordering the beach, is Honolulu’s fanciest shopping street, dense with tourist-centric development; the Hyatt, Marriott, and Sheraton hotels stand within steps of one another, flanked by high-end shops like Jimmy Choo and Fendi. The white noise of the ocean tempers the sound of traffic and the gentle if omnipresent tones of Hawaiian music, both live and recorded, emanating from the resorts.

In the past fifteen years, Kalākaua Avenue’s 20th-century stalwarts have been upgraded to keep pace with this more recent development. The open-air, banyan-shaded International Marketplace re-opened in 2016 after a $500 million renovation; the landmark pink behemoth of the Royal Hawaiian and the colonial columns at Moana Surfrider have been brightened up. Sidewalks have been repaved with gleaming white flagstone. But walk a few blocks inland, and you are surrounded by midcentury mid-rise apartment buildings, their exterior walkways and lanais constructed of breezeblock and lava rock, untouched signage riveted to their walls — “Skyliner,” “Waikīkī Winds,” “Pan Pacific.” Palms and banyans disappear along with the breeze, and heat rising from the concrete becomes more noticeable. A few blocks farther, and you’ll hit the stagnant waters of the two-mile-long Ala Wai Canal.
